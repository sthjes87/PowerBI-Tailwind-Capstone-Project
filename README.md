## Profit Report: Detailed Overview

As part of the project, I developed a **Profit Overview Report** that highlights key profit metrics through various visualizations:

- **Net Revenue by Product**: A bar chart visualizing product-level net revenue, enabling better product strategy decisions.
- **Yearly Profit Margin by Country**: A donut chart presenting profit margin distribution across different countries.
- **Yearly Profit Margin Over Time**: An area chart tracking profit trends over time, helping stakeholders monitor long-term profitability.

Additionally, key metrics such as **YTD Profit** and **Net Revenue USD** were displayed using cards for quick reference, and a **KPI** for **Gross Revenue USD** provided real-time performance tracking.

## Executive Dashboard: High-Level Insights

To provide executives with a high-level, mobile-friendly view of the companyâ€™s global performance, I developed an **Executive Dashboard** that focuses on key metrics such as sales quantities and profit margins:

### Features:
- **Sales Overview Visuals**: Included visuals like **Loyalty Points by Country**, **Quantity Sold by Product**, and **Median Sales Distribution by Country**.
- **Profit Overview Visuals**: Pinned key charts such as **Net Revenue by Product**, **Yearly Profit Margin by Country**, and **Yearly Profit Margin Over Time**.
- **Card Visualizations**: Displayed **YTD Profit**, **Net Revenue USD**, and **Gross Revenue USD** as cards and KPIs for quick, actionable insights.
- **Mobile Layout**: Configured a mobile-friendly layout for easy access to key metrics and visuals from mobile devices, ensuring that important data is available anywhere.

## Alerts and Subscriptions: Automating Insights

To ensure stakeholders are always informed, I configured alerts and subscriptions to provide timely updates on key performance indicators.

### 1. **Alerts**:
   - Created a daily alert for **Gross Revenue USD**, which triggers if revenue falls below $400, ensuring immediate action if revenue decreases.

### 2. **Subscriptions**:
   - **Sales Weekly Summary**: A subscription that provides an overview of key sales metrics, delivered every Monday at 5:00 AM, helping stakeholders stay on top of sales performance.
   - **Profit Weekly Summary**: Another subscription for profit metrics, delivered every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 6:00 AM, providing regular updates on profitability.

These alerts and subscriptions ensure that the executive team receives regular, proactive updates, enabling them to make data-driven decisions with confidence.
