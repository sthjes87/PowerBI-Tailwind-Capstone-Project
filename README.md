## Project features

- **Data Preparation with Excel**:
    - Calculated data using **Excel formulas**.
    - Sales datas was structured to ensure it was ready for deeper analysis within Power BI.

- **Power BI for Visualization**:
    - Generated tables by uploading Excel files into Power BI;
    - Cleaned and transformed raw sales data using **Power Query**;
    - Implement **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** to create customs calculations, including advanced sales forecasts and profitability metrics;
    - Built **interactive dashboards** for a comprehensice view of sales trends, product performance, and regional sales Analysis.
    

- **Power BI Service**:
    - Published the Power BI Desktop reports to **Power BI Service** to allow for easy sharing, colaboration, and access to the reports online.
    - The dashboards are accessible to stakeholders via Power BI Online, ensuring that real-time insights are readly available to decision-makers.

- **Python for Data Augmentation**:
    - Developed Python scripts using **Pandas** to generate exchange rate table, witch then integrated with the sales data to provide a multi-currency analysis.

- **Git for Version Control**:
    - Managed the project lifecycle using **Git** to ensure all versions of the analysis and reports were properly tracked and easily revertible.
